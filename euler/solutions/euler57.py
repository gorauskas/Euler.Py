Project Euler Problem 57

    It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an
    infinite continued fraction.

      âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...

    By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

      1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
      1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
      1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
      1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...

    The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth
    expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in the
    numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

    In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a
    numerator with more digits than denominator?
