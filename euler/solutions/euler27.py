Project Euler Problem 27:

    Euler published the remarkable quadratic formula:

    n² + n + 41

    It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive
    values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is
    divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41² + 41 + 41 is clearly
    divisible by 41.

    Using computers, the incredible formula  n² - 79n + 1601 was discovered,
    which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The
    product of the coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126479.

    Considering quadratics of the form:

    n² + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000

    where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
    e.g. |11| = 11 and |-4| = 4

    Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic
    expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive
    values of n, starting with n = 0.
